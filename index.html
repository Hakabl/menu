        About Chang Family Menu: My mom is a great cook, and I have decided to make a website about some of the dishes she cooks because we have been joking for a long time that she should start her own resturant. I only put a couple on here as I didn't want to expose all of her delicious secrets. She is the cook for our family. Her parents are also great at cooking, but because I couldn't find any pictures of the food they make, I had to exclude them from this website.
